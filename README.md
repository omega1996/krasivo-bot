# Krasivo Bot

A Telegram bot built with TypeScript that provides AI-powered responses and keyword-triggered actions. The bot uses MongoDB to store conversation history and model settings.

## Quick Start

### For Development

1. **Start MongoDB services** (required for bot functionality):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up mongo mongo-express -d
   ```
   This starts:
   - MongoDB database on port 27017
   - Mongo Express (web interface) on port 8081

2. **Install dependencies and run the bot**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   bun run index.ts
   ```

### For Production

Run the complete stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts all services including the Telegram bot container.

## Architecture

The bot consists of several key components:

- **Telegram Bot**: Handles incoming messages and responses
- **MongoDB**: Stores conversation history per chat and bot settings
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI-compatible API for generating responses
- **Keyword Actions**: Triggers specific actions based on message content

### Data Storage

MongoDB stores:
- **Conversation History**: Message threads organized by chat ID
- **Bot Settings**: Model configuration, cooldown settings, system prompts
- **Admin Settings**: Configuration managed through admin commands
